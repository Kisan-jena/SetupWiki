# Dev Setup Guides

A structured collection of setup guides and environment configuration instructions for modern full-stack development.  
This repository organizes essential steps, commands, and configurations for setting up:

- React (web applications)
- Next.js (full-stack applications)
- React Native / Expo (mobile development)
- Python backends (Flask / FastAPI)
- Common tooling (Node, Git, VS Code, package managers, etc.)

The purpose of this project is to create a unified, reusable reference for initializing new development machines and projects efficiently.
